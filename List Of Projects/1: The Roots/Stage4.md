# Stage 4: Basic Operations and Expressions (Projects 25-32)

**Learning Goal**: Master operators and expression evaluation

## R25: **Complex Expression Evaluator**

- **Description**: Build a mathematical expression evaluator that computes 10 complex expressions involving multiple operators and parentheses. Show step-by-step evaluation, demonstrating operator precedence. Include expressions like: ((a + b) *c) / (d - e), a + b* c - d / e, etc.
- **Prerequisites**: R10, R19
- **New Concept**: Operator precedence and complex expressions

## R26: **Modulo Application Suite**

- **Description**: Create a practical modulo operator demonstrator with 5 real-world applications: checking even/odd, finding remainder of division, cycling through values (like days of week), digit extraction from numbers, and checking divisibility. Show clear examples with user input.
- **Prerequisites**: R21, R25
- **New Concept**: Modulo operator applications

## R27: **Increment/Decrement Laboratory**

- **Description**: Develop a comprehensive demonstration of pre and post increment/decrement operators. Show 10 different scenarios where the difference matters, including in expressions, function arguments (simulated), and loop conditions. Display values before, during, and after operations.
- **Prerequisites**: R9, R25
- **New Concept**: Pre/post increment and decrement

## R28: **Bitwise Operations Toolkit**

- **Description**: Build a bitwise calculator that performs AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift operations on user-provided integers. Display inputs and results in both decimal and binary format (using manual conversion). Include practical examples like flag checking.
- **Prerequisites**: R15, R23
- **New Concept**: Bitwise operators

## R29: **Logical Expression Tester**

- **Description**: Create a logic gate simulator that evaluates complex logical expressions. Test AND, OR, NOT operations with at least 10 different combinations. Include truth table displays and compound conditions like (a > 5 && b < 10) || (c == 0).
- **Prerequisites**: R22, R25
- **New Concept**: Logical operators and boolean logic

## R30: **Assignment Operator Showcase**

- **Description**: Implement a variable manipulation program demonstrating all compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=). Show before and after values for each operation with clear explanations of what each operator does.
- **Prerequisites**: R10, R27, R28
- **New Concept**: Compound assignment operators

## R31: **Ternary Decision Maker**

- **Description**: Build a decision-making system using only ternary operators for: finding maximum/minimum of three numbers, converting numerical grades to pass/fail, selecting messages based on conditions, nested ternary operations, and simulating simple if-else logic. No if statements allowed!
- **Prerequisites**: R22, R29
- **New Concept**: Ternary conditional operator

## R32: **TEST: Scientific Calculator**

- **Description**: Create a fully functional scientific calculator that: supports basic arithmetic with proper precedence, includes modulo and power operations (using repeated multiplication), performs bitwise operations with binary display, evaluates logical expressions, uses ternary operators for result formatting, demonstrates all assignment operators, handles complex nested expressions, validates all inputs, and displays step-by-step calculation process.
- **Prerequisites**: R25-R31
- **New Concept**: Integration of all expression and operator concepts
