# Stage 3: Input and Basic Interaction (Projects 17-24)

**Learning Goal**: Handle user input and create interactive programs

## R17: **Interactive Number Reader**

- **Description**: Create a number analysis program that prompts for and reads 5 different integers from the user. Display each number back with analysis: whether it's positive/negative, even/odd, and its square. Use clear prompts and formatted output.
- **Prerequisites**: R9, R10
- **New Concept**: scanf() for integer input

## R18: **Personal Information System**

- **Description**: Build an interactive profile creator that collects user's first name, age, height (float), and favorite letter (char). Store each in appropriate variables and create a formatted profile card display. Handle input with proper prompts and error-clear instructions.
- **Prerequisites**: R9, R17
- **New Concept**: scanf() with multiple data types

## R19: **Age Calculator Pro**

- **Description**: Develop a comprehensive age calculator that asks for birth year and current year, then calculates and displays: age in years, approximate age in months, days, hours, and minutes. Include leap year consideration in calculations.
- **Prerequisites**: R10, R17
- **New Concept**: Multi-step calculations with input

## R20: **Universal Temperature Converter**

- **Description**: Create an advanced temperature converter that reads a temperature and converts between all three scales (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin). Display results in a formatted table with 2 decimal precision. Include the formulas used in comments.
- **Prerequisites**: R14, R17, R18
- **New Concept**: Complex calculations with user input

## R21: **Math Quiz Generator**

- **Description**: Build an interactive math quiz that presents 5 problems with hardcoded values, reads user answers, calculates the correct answers, and shows both user and correct answers. Include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo problems.
- **Prerequisites**: R10, R17
- **New Concept**: Comparing user input with calculated results

## R22: **Input Validation Suite**

- **Description**: Create a robust input handler that reads 5 different values and validates each: positive integer check, range check (1-100), non-zero check for division, character validation (letter vs digit), and float precision validation. Display validation results for each input.
- **Prerequisites**: R17, R18
- **New Concept**: Basic input validation logic

## R23: **Multi-Format Input Handler**

- **Description**: Develop a data collection system that demonstrates reading different formats: integers in decimal and hexadecimal, floats with different precision, characters including spaces, and multiple values in one scanf(). Show proper format specifier usage.
- **Prerequisites**: R6, R18
- **New Concept**: Advanced scanf() format specifiers

## R24: **TEST: Student Grade Calculator**

- **Description**: Create a complete grade calculation system that: collects student name and ID, reads scores for 5 subjects (with validation for 0-100 range), calculates total and average, converts average to letter grade, determines pass/fail status, handles invalid inputs gracefully, displays a formatted report card, and shows all calculations step by step.
- **Prerequisites**: R17-R23
- **New Concept**: Integration of all Stage 3 concepts
