# Stage 2: Variables and Basic Data (Projects 9-16)

**Learning Goal**: Master variable declaration, initialization, and basic data types

## R9: **Variable Storage System**

- **Description**: Create a personal data storage program that declares and initializes at least 10 variables of different types (int, float, double, char). Store information like age, height, weight, grade, initial, and display them with descriptive labels. Show proper variable naming conventions.
- **Prerequisites**: R1, R4
- **New Concept**: Variable declaration and initialization

## R10: **Arithmetic Calculator Engine**

- **Description**: Build a calculation engine that performs 10 different operations on integer variables. Declare variables for operands, perform calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo), store results in new variables, and display a formatted calculation report.
- **Prerequisites**: R3, R9
- **New Concept**: Variables in arithmetic operations

## R11: **Precision Comparison Lab**

- **Description**: Create a scientific precision tester that demonstrates the difference between float and double. Perform the same 5 calculations using both types, showing how precision affects results. Include division by large numbers, very small decimals, and mathematical constants like PI.
- **Prerequisites**: R6, R9
- **New Concept**: Float vs double precision

## R12: **Character Encoding Explorer**

- **Description**: Build a character analysis program that stores 10 different characters in variables and displays them with their ASCII codes. Show letters, numbers, symbols, and special characters. Create a formatted ASCII table showing character, decimal code, and hexadecimal code.
- **Prerequisites**: R6, R9
- **New Concept**: Character data type and ASCII

## R13: **Variable Swap Magic**

- **Description**: Implement 3 different swapping techniques: using a temporary variable, using arithmetic (for numbers), and using XOR (for integers). Create a program that demonstrates all three methods with different pairs of variables, showing before and after values.
- **Prerequisites**: R9, R10
- **New Concept**: Variable swapping algorithms

## R14: **Constants Definition System**

- **Description**: Create a physics constants program using both #define and const. Define at least 10 constants (PI, GRAVITY, SPEED_OF_LIGHT, etc.) and use them in 5 different calculations. Show the difference between preprocessor constants and const variables.
- **Prerequisites**: R7, R9
- **New Concept**: Constants (#define and const)

## R15: **Data Type Size Explorer**

- **Description**: Build a comprehensive data type analyzer that uses sizeof() to display the memory size of all basic data types, arrays of different sizes, and expressions. Create a formatted table showing type name, size in bytes, and size in bits for at least 15 different cases.
- **Prerequisites**: R4, R9
- **New Concept**: sizeof() operator

## R16: **TEST: Temperature Weather Station**

- **Description**: Create a weather monitoring station that: stores temperature readings in Celsius (double), converts to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, stores weather condition as char code ('S'=Sunny, 'R'=Rainy, etc.), uses constants for conversion formulas, displays all data in a formatted weather report, shows memory usage of all variables, includes min/max temperature constants, and demonstrates variable swapping for high/low temps.
- **Prerequisites**: R9-R15
- **New Concept**: Integration of all Stage 2 concepts
