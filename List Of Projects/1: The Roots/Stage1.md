# Stage 1: First Contact (Projects 1-8)

**Learning Goal**: Understand basic program structure and simple output

## R1: **Message Display System**

- **Description**: Create a program that displays multiple messages using different printf() statements. You'll output at least 5 different messages including a greeting, your name, today's date, a favorite quote, and a sign-off message. This teaches you how to structure a C program and use the printf() function.
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **New Concept**: Program structure, printf() function

## R2: **Code Documentation Explorer**

- **Description**: Build a heavily commented "About Me" program that displays personal information. Every single line must have a comment explaining what it does, including why we use #include, what main() means, and how printf() works. The output should display at least 10 facts about yourself.
- **Prerequisites**: R1
- **New Concept**: Comments (single-line // and multi-line /**/)

## R3: **Arithmetic Results Display**

- **Description**: Create a calculator display that shows the results of 10 different arithmetic operations using hardcoded values. Display operations like 45 + 23 = 68, showing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. Format the output as a neat calculation sheet.
- **Prerequisites**: R1
- **New Concept**: Arithmetic operations in printf()

## R4: **Formatted Output Designer**

- **Description**: Design a formatted receipt or invoice display using printf() with width specifiers, alignment, and precision. Create a mock store receipt showing at least 5 items with prices aligned in columns, subtotal, tax, and total. Use format specifiers like %10s, %-15s, %8.2f.
- **Prerequisites**: R1, R3
- **New Concept**: Printf format specifiers and alignment

## R5: **Escape Sequence Art Gallery**

- **Description**: Create an "art gallery" program that displays 5 different ASCII art pieces using escape sequences. Use \n for new lines, \t for spacing, \" for quotes in speech bubbles, and \\ for art elements. Each art piece should demonstrate a different escape sequence.
- **Prerequisites**: R1
- **New Concept**: Escape sequences (\n, \t, \", \\)

## R6: **Data Display Formats**

- **Description**: Build a scientific data display showing the same 5 numerical values in different formats: integer (%d), float with 2 decimals (%.2f), scientific notation (%e), hexadecimal (%x), and octal (%o). Create a table-like output showing how 5 different numbers look in each format.
- **Prerequisites**: R1, R3, R4
- **New Concept**: Number format specifiers

## R7: **System Information Display**

- **Description**: Create a system information program that displays compile-time information using preprocessor macros. Show the compilation date (**DATE**), time (**TIME**), filename (**FILE**), and line numbers (**LINE**) at different points. Format it as a system report.
- **Prerequisites**: R1, R2
- **New Concept**: Preprocessor macros

## R8: **TEST: Multi-Feature Display Program**

- **Description**: Create a complete "Student Information System" display that combines all concepts learned. Display a formatted student report card with: header with ASCII art border, student details in aligned columns, 5 subjects with grades shown in different number formats, extensive comments explaining the code, proper use of escape sequences, and compilation timestamp at the bottom.
- **Prerequisites**: R1-R7
- **New Concept**: Integration of all Stage 1 concepts
