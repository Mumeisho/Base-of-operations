- **New Concept**: Sorting algorithm

## TB63: **Array Merge Utility**

- **Description**: Build a merger for sorted arrays that: combines two sorted arrays into one, handles different sizes, removes duplicates option, and maintains sort order. Show merge process.
- **Prerequisites**: TB62, TB60
- **New Concept**: Merge algorithm

## TB64: **Frequency Counter System**

- **Description**: Create a frequency analyzer that counts occurrences of each unique element, finds mode, creates frequency histogram, and identifies duplicate elements with their counts.

- **Prerequisites**: TB66
- **New Concept**: Complex matrix algorithm

## TB68: **Array Bounds Protector**

- **Description**: Build a safe array system with functions that check bounds before access, report out-of-bounds attempts, provide safe get/set operations, and demonstrate buffer overflow prevention.
- **Prerequisites**: TB56, TB48
- **New Concept**: Array safety

## TB69: **Dynamic Array Simulator**
