# C Programming Mastery: 400-Project Curriculum

## Curriculum Philosophy

This curriculum follows the **redwood tree model** - establishing deep roots in fundamentals, building a thick trunk of essential skills, then branching into specialized areas. Each project introduces **one new concept** while reinforcing 3-5 previously learned skills. The progression follows proven educational principles: **PRIMM methodology** (Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make), **mastery-based advancement**, and **cognitive load management**.

**Mastery Checkpoints**: Every 20 projects includes a comprehensive assessment requiring 85% proficiency before advancement.
