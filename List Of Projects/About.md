# C Programming Mastery: 400-Project Curriculum

## Curriculum Philosophy

This curriculum follows the **redwood tree model** - establishing deep roots in fundamentals, building a thick trunk of essential skills, then branching into specialized areas. Each project introduces **one new concept** while reinforcing 3-5 previously learned skills. The progression follows proven educational principles: **PRIMM methodology** (Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make), **mastery-based advancement**, and **cognitive load management**.

**Mastery Checkpoints**: Every stage includes comprehensive test projects requiring 85% proficiency before advancement.

## Learning Checkpoints and Assessment

### Test Projects

Test projects appear at the end of each stage and comprehensively assess all concepts learned in that stage. They are marked with "TEST" in their descriptions.

### Portfolio Milestones

- **Project 32 (R32)**: Foundation concepts portfolio
- **Project 104 (TB72)**: Control structures and functions showcase
- **Project 176 (LB72)**: Pointers and structures mastery
- **Project 248 (MB72)**: Systems programming portfolio

### Prerequisites and Dependencies

All prerequisites are listed with each project using project identifiers. The curriculum is designed so that each project builds on previous knowledge while introducing exactly one new concept.

This curriculum provides a comprehensive, project-based journey through C programming, building from absolute basics to advanced specialization while maintaining the principle of incremental learning and strong foundational skills.
