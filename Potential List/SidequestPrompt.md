- **Real-time updates** using WebSocket for timer synchronization

### Data Integrity

- **Prerequisite validation**: Prevent starting trunk projects out of order
- **Branch unlocking**: Only after trunk completion
- **Time tracking validation**: Prevent negative times, reasonable limits
- **Progress consistency**: Ensure progress data matches project completions

### Special C Programming Features

- **Code file integration**: Link to actual C project files
- **Compiler output logging**: Track compilation errors and warnings  
- **Memory debugging integration**: Valgrind output parsing
- **Performance benchmark tracking**: Execution time, memory usage
